At the moment, you are unable to create a new user from the Synthi user interface and will need to do it manually from the backend. If you forget your password, you will also need to reset it from the backend.

For more information, visit the **[Creating Users & Organizations](/sections/CreatingUsersAndOrganizations.md)** section.
{% endhint %}

Visit the root URL for your Synthi instance. If you are not signed in, you will see the sign-in page. Enter your username and password and select the **Sign In** button to submit the form.

If your login is successful, Synthi will navigate to its main dashboard where you'll be able to manage your datasets.
