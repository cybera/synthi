# Logging In & Signing Out

{% hint type="info" %}
At the moment, you are unable to create a new user from the ADI user interface and will need to do it manually from the backend. If you forget your password, you will also need to reset it from the backend.

For more information, visit the **Creating a New User** section.
{% endhint %}

## Log In

Visit the root URL for your ADI instance. If you are not signed in, you will be met by a login form. Enter your username and password and select the **Sign In** button to submit the form.

If your login is successful, ADI will navigate to its main dashboard where you'll be able to manage your datasets.
