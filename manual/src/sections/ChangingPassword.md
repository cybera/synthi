# Changing Password

{% hint style="info" %}
Follow these steps to change your password if you already have access to your account. 
Note that youâ€™ll be required to change your password if you have been given access to the Synthi platform by an Synthi administrator.
Please visit the **[Creating Users & Organizations](/sections/CreatingUsersAndOrganizations.md)** section to know more about creating a new user profile.
 {% endhint %}

From any page in Synthi, locate the **green user icon** in the top-right corner of the screen (next to the name of your user/organization).

Select the icon to activate a dropdown menu. Select the **Profile** option.
